# Mi Band 3
Library to work with Xiaomi Mi Band 3

Library based on Yojesh Ojha's library:-

#[Medium Article](https://medium.com/@yogeshojha/i-hacked-xiaomi-miband-3-and-here-is-how-i-did-it-43d68c272391)

Yojesh Ojha's library is amazing. But there are quite a few bugs and the libraries are out-dated.
So, I fixed the bugs and made some minor changes.

The Heart rate feature seems to glitchy even after some fixes. (I am working on it!)
Please report any bugs.
